          <p>
            Saka-Keja is a real estate platform that connects property owners
            and tenants. We aim to make the process of finding a home or
            renting out a property easy, efficient, and stress-free. Our
            platform allows property owners to list their properties for rent,
            and tenants can easily search for properties that meet their
            requirements.
